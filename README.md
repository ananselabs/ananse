## <img src="ananse.svg" width="30"/> What is Ananse?

**Ananse** is a production-ready service mesh data plane built in Go, named after the Akan folktale spider known for wisdom and cleverness. What began as a simple load balancer has evolved into a robust traffic management system featuring circuit breakers, intelligent retries, and comprehensive observability.

- **Current State:** Fully functional reverse proxy with advanced resilience patterns
- **Vision:** A complete service mesh with dynamic control plane, policy management, and distributed tracing

### Why Ananse?

This project is both a learning journey and a practical implementation of distributed systems patterns. Each feature is battle-tested through chaos engineering and high-concurrency stress tests, making it a valuable reference for understanding how production systems handle failure at scale.

## ✨ Key Features

### Traffic Management
- **Load Balancing Strategies**: Round-Robin and Least-Connections algorithms
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failure detection with Open/HalfOpen/Closed state machine
- **Intelligent Retries**: Passive health checks with exponential backoff
- **Active Health Monitoring**: Continuous backend health checks with automatic recovery

### Resilience & Testing
- **Thread-Safe Backend Pool**: Atomic operations and RWMutex for safe concurrent access
- **Chaos Engineering**: Built-in chaos monkey for service disruption simulation
- **High-Velocity Load Testing**: Stress test scripts supporting 2000+ concurrent requests
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fail-fast behavior preventing cascading failures

### Observability
- **Prometheus Integration**: Scraped metrics for request counts, latencies, and circuit breaker states
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-configured visualizations for system health
- **Alerting**: Threshold-based alerts for error rates and service availability

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go** (1.23+)
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (for monitoring stack)

### 1. Start the Infrastructure

First, spin up the monitoring stack (Prometheus & Grafana):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Run the Services

Use the helper script to start the mesh and all backend microservices:

```bash
./start_services.sh
```

The mesh entry point will be running at `http://localhost:8089`.

### 3. Test the Proxy

Send requests through the mesh to any backend service:

```bash
# Route to auth service
curl http://localhost:8089/auth

# Route to users service
curl http://localhost:8089/users

# Route to payments service
curl http://localhost:8089/payments

# Route to analytics service
curl http://localhost:8089/analytics
```

The proxy will automatically load balance requests, handle failures with circuit breakers, and retry on transient errors.

### 4. Watch Resilience in Action

Open three terminals to observe the system under stress:

**Terminal 1** - Generate load:
```bash
./load_test.sh
```

**Terminal 2** - Introduce chaos:
```bash
./chaos_monkey.sh
```

**Terminal 3** - Watch metrics:
```bash
# Check circuit breaker states
curl http://localhost:8089/metrics | grep circuit_breaker_state

# Check success vs failure rates
curl http://localhost:8089/metrics | grep requests_total
```

Visit Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see real-time dashboards showing:
- Request latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Circuit breaker state transitions
- Backend health status
- Error rate trends

## 🧪 Experiments

### Load Testing

Simulate high traffic with spikes and variable latency:

```bash
./load_test.sh
```

### Chaos Engineering

Unleash the Chaos Monkey to randomly kill and revive backend services:

```bash
./chaos_monkey.sh
```

## 📊 Monitoring

- **Prometheus**: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
- **Grafana**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (Login: `admin` / `admin`)
